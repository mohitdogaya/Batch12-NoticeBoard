        <h1>Maharana Pratap: A Legacy of Courage</h1>

        <!-- History Section -->
        <section class="history" id="history">
            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>
                Maharana Pratap Singh I (1540–1597) was the 13th ruler of the Mewar region in present-day Rajasthan,
                India. He belonged to the Sisodia clan of Rajputs and is celebrated as one of the greatest warriors in
                Indian history. Born to Maharana Udai Singh II and Maharani Jaiwanta Bai, Pratap was known for his
                fearless spirit, deep sense of honor, and dedication to his kingdom and people.
            </p>
            <p>
                Pratap ascended the throne in 1572 during a time when the Mughal Emperor Akbar was aggressively
                expanding his empire. While many other Rajput kings surrendered or allied with the Mughals, Maharana
                Pratap stood firm and refused to bow down. He became a symbol of resistance and the undying spirit of
                freedom.
            </p>

            <h3>What He Did</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Refused to submit to the Mughal Empire</strong> even when offered peace and wealth.</li>
                <li><strong>Led the historic Battle of Haldighati (1576)</strong> against a much larger Mughal force
                    with incredible bravery.</li>
                <li><strong>Used guerrilla warfare tactics</strong> to reclaim much of his lost territory.</li>
                <li><strong>Lived a simple, difficult life in exile</strong> to protect the independence of his people.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Inspired loyalty and unity</strong> among his soldiers, nobles, and common citizens.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>What Students Can Learn from Him</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Courage and bravery:</strong> Stand up for what's right, even when it's hard.</li>
                <li><strong>Self-respect and integrity:</strong> Never compromise your values for personal gain.</li>
                <li><strong>Patriotism:</strong> Love and serve your country with loyalty and pride.</li>
                <li><strong>Resilience:</strong> Keep trying and never give up, no matter how tough life gets.</li>
                <li><strong>Leadership:</strong> True leaders lead by example and inspire others to do good.</li>
                <li><strong>Sacrifice:</strong> Greatness often requires personal sacrifice for a larger cause.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                Maharana Pratap’s life continues to inspire generations with its message of unwavering determination,
                honor, and sacrifice. He remains a timeless example of a true hero who lived and died for the freedom
                and dignity of his people.
